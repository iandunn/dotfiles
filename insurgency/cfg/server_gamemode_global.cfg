	// oh, came across this in a custom map description, sound relevant: "To start a solo game enable console in the settings, rebind it to f11, open the console and type "map mapname mode" for example: map estates_b4 occupy. Do this without starting a solo playlist or another map will load."
	// it's probably the sv_playlist variable. maybe should unset that in server.cfg or here?
