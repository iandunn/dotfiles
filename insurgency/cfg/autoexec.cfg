echo "Applying autoexec"

// Note:
// For some options, it seems like `exec autoexec` in the console is enough to load them, after saving this file.
// For others, you have to exit back to the main menu, or even exit the whole game.
// This is only for client-side options. Server options must go in `server.cfg`, `server_{gamemode}.cfg`, etc.

//// - adjust default loadouts to match what you normally use. maybe set by the server? might be able to create a theater for it? glean info from https://github.com/jaredballou/insurgency-theaters/tree/master/
    // or bind keys or custom command to use `inventory_buy_weapon` command? -  https://steamcommunity.com/app/222880/discussions/3/622954302091790259/
    // probably want to use `alias` instead of binding keys, so open console and type `sniper` for default sniper loadout, `specialist` for theirs, etc
    // asked here - https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/372993/how-do-buy-binds-loadout-macros-work-in-insurgency
//// - maybe this isn't being executing automatically when the program starts? if so probaly need to add `exec autoexec` to config.cfg
//// - hide the hud timer ABC etc? but still wanna see when press tab or something
// - dont switch to a grenade when picking it up - not cl_grenade_auto_switch that's about switching back to primary
// whats hq_radio_cooldown ? look in console
// disable cl_forcepreload b/c buggy? -- https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/topic/4571-harmful-misconceptions-in-launch-options-and-console-commandsarguments-for-source-engine-based-games/
    // causes stuttering and lag spikes? maybe that's why you get pauses while trying to set loadout on remote servers?

// todo - test if having this makes it easier to hear people talk clearly
"snd_radio_filter" "0"

// - get a radio symbol like in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KB3HIUhspg when you're talking. maybe it does already? but doesn't seem like it
// or maybe that was just in the old version? or maybe mic isn't setup correctly

cl_hud_compass_appear_enemy "4.0" // longer b/c i'm old and can't react quicklys

// todo cl_hud_deathnotice_display will turn them off even when server has them turned on?
// are there other settings to ignore the noise servers display?

// todo can disable mac ctrl hotkey while playing, so that don't always switch virtual desktops while crouching?
// this file prob can't exec shell script, but maybe can have a script that turns them off, launchs insurg, then turns them back on when insurg process quits
// or a daemon that checks if insurg is running, and disabled it when it is, and enables it when it's not. could poll every 30 seconds or whatever

//// Functions you can't bind through the UI

// Instantly resupply at spawn1
bind "a" "inventory_resupply"

// Mute annoying sounds like sprinkers (have to press every time they start going off again)
// also stops pre-game announcer describing the mission
bind "k" "snd_restart"

// todo maybe something on left hand, so don't have to leave mouse? t? e? f?


//// Performance

// Update player locations as quickly as possible, if the server supports it
