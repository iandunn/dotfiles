// This is only for settings that apply to all game modes. Individual mode files like `server_occupy.cfg` will override anything here.

// todo can setup conquere where destroying each cache lowers their numbers, rather than having to destroy them ALL to lower?
	// if so, could setup horde mode
	// but really you want a mode where there's no points to cap, only caches to destroy
	// first one is hardest, but they get easier after that
	// or maybe it should be reverse where numbers increase at each cache

// todo can i create a custom map cycle that includes all the extra maps i've downloaded?
	// bare minimum: launch with concsole command, hardcode maps + their supported game modes
		// it's a playlist?
	// extras: automatically add non-core maps, see it in menus
