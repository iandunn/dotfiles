"mp_wave_capture_increment"	"10"	// Closer to `mp_cp_capture_time`. Default `1` is just too fast/easy.

// todo there's some problem where waves go from 7 to 0 right after game starts
// what changed? maybe adding server_solo.cfg?
// it was happening before adding the no_smoke theater
// added snd_radio_filter cl_hud_voices_show_local but no reason that should affect it
// was after adding the count 7 and cap increment i'm pretty sure, but test
	// worked after commenting them out, so maybe that is problem? test more
	// enabled them and it still worked, though, so maybe unrelated, or just a game bug you can't fix
	// now it's happening again, and to push too, so can prob assume that not something in this file
	// oh, it's happening even with all the custom stuff disabled, so maybe it's a bug with playing solo?
	// maybe `mp_wave_dpr_attackers` et all being a fraction, it only counts you and not the bots, so it rounds down to 0? but why happens sometimes and not others?
		// that might have worked, need more testing
		// turned it off and ok so far, so maybe unrelated.
		// maybe just have to restart the entire app when it happens?
		// maybe when i kick bots, it gets messed up?
	// could also be the difference between starting the push/occupy match via the `solo menu`, compared to doing it via `map sinjar occupy` ?


// moved lots of stuff from server.cfg to server_gamemode_global, maybe that's it?

// turn on and off manully?
