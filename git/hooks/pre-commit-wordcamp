# TODO
#
# deprecated this, and migrate the functionality to the PHP `pre-push` script.
#
# - Restrict changed files to only PHP for `php -l` and PHPMD, then PHP and CSS for PHPCS.
# - This all assumes that the state is clean. If a changed file is dirty, `php -l`, etc will be run against the
#   dirty file on disk, not the contents of that file at `HEAD`. We could maybe stash unstaged changes, run this
#   then pop the stash, but that feels bad. Line numbers wouldn't necessary match up between `php -l` output and
#   the file after popping the stash, and there may be merge conflicts when popping in some cases?
# - Only run PHPCS/PHPMD over changed lines, not entire files?
# - Maybe make these functions more DRY, since they're all pretty similar.
