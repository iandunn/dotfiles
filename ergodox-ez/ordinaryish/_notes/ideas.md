# ideas for improvements to layout

iirc tthere's other text files saved in 'ergo documentation' folder that have lots more



maybe make outer 2u keys layer toggle
then make inner 2u keys delete / enter on the layer

could be nice for del key, but having to chord enter would be bad
maybe only do it on left side b/c now all nav layer on right side?

------------------
maybe also get rid of the alt-left right etc and just chord? but already chording so it'd be bad

like this so far
-----------------


if thumb arrows work, then maybe "nav" layer becomes "shortcuts", like the cmd-stf-[ stuff ?




--------

* not using hyper/meh
	maybe use for something else instead
	but uncomfortable to reach, probably better to leave empty

* not taking advantage of layers

* have to use hard to reach keys


having trouble w/
	* 7
		maybe remove the keycap left of it, and don't use that key?
		or shift things to the right? but then what happens to = ?

	* tab and backtick
		move esc into old caps lock pos?

	* up/down/left/right
		move to layer on home keys?
		maybe move left hand straight down to bottom row, and then hold down old hyper/meh key, and get a arrow pad on right hand home row
		could do same for number pad on opposite side

	* [] and {}

	_+

hold down key on home row to make it a modifier
	i tried before and stopped, but maybe try again
	don't wanna hold, but already doing that w/ bottom row mods

	vallack says that dedicated shift and ctrl keys makes home row mods easier b/c avoid some of the problems
	so just put cmd and alt

one shot mods would be nice but orxy/qmk bug
	that's worked around now w/ callum implementation
