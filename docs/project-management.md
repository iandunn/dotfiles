- [ ] Identify stakeholders early and engage w/ them. include any affected people ("not about us without us")
- [ ] Get explicit expectations for timeline & deliverables
- [ ] prioritize deliverables up front, decide what gets cut if need to meet deadline.
	goals/features/tasks spreadsheet from https://projectmanagementfoundations.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/vision-and-goals.pdf
- [ ] Create estimates for the work and communicate them
	break everything down into specific tasks, small enough to flesh out assumptions. make small enough that none take longer than ~18 hours
	will take longer when
	    team hasn't worked together
	    hasn't done this type of work before
	    collaborating w/ other teams
	    holidays
	    working on other projects at same time, or maintenance rotations
	include generous padding for unknown unknowns
	techniques
		multiply casual/basic/rough estimate by 2-4
		PERT: ( Optimal + ( 4 * likely ) + Pessimistic ) / 6
			don't like much b/c relies on likely being very accurate, but that's not realistic
			could adjust the factor from 2 and then divide by 4? that doesn't help much
		w-delphi - team based
- [ ] factor in time for bug reports and feature requests
- [ ] leave room at end of project timeline b/c last 20% takes significantly more than 20% of time
	because lots of detail work and polishing, also because people tend to leave hard/complex/unknown stuff to the end
	this sounds like too much, but have seen it happen to a large extent

- [ ] re-evaluate and communicate estimates at regular intervals
	cone of uncertainty / construx chart - https://projectmanagementfoundations.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/time-and-estimates.pdf
- [ ] get stakeholder feedback at regular intervals


* PM triangle: any time change scope, deadline, quality, then the others have to change
* first focus on the things that are highest priority, most difficult, and most unknown. then finish w/ the easy stuff.



## When a project is late

Most of the time, the best thing is to cut scope. If necessary, push the deadline.

Adding people is only good it they'll be on the project long term. drive-by contributions are low quality because they don't have institutional knowledge and must be more heavily reviewed, bugs fixed, architecture problems created, etc

Can also lower quality to some extent, but not worth it long term

## TODO

* paraphrase your takeaways from the basic links in that section
* add short summary of each link in terms section
